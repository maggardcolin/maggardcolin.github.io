                <h3>How the Interactive Course Map works</h3>
                <p>
                    I placed an "image map" on a <a href="https://sankeymatic.com/build/">Sankey diagram</a> that I created manually, which is essentially an overlay on top of the 
                    image that stores location data for each of the class boxes. Each of the class boxes is manually coded using coordinates 
                    onto the image, and the textbox associated with each course is not visible unless the class box is hovered over. 
                    I also used JavaScript to update the CSS for the textbox to make it follow the user's mouse when it is over the associated 
                    coursebox.

                <h3>How the sorting and filtering options on this page work</h3>
                <p>
                    Each project is placed into its own container, and assigned various attributes based on what type of project it is. 
                    I used JavaScript to make it so that each time the values are updated (or the page is loaded), the selected inputs are 
                    applied to the display. I wanted to create a robust and customizable system that would allow me to easily enter and display 
                    projects and work experiences that I have been and am currently engaged in.

                <h3>How the site works on various resolutions and displays</h3>
                <p>
                    Making this website reflexive (work on all displays) was the most difficult task that this project presented. In order to do this, 
                    I used a combination of JavaScript code and CSS rules to update the page depending on the size of the user's browser window as well as 
                    the type of device that they are using. For example, the advanced search box on this page looks different on mobile devices as well as smaller 
                    browser windows. I encourage you to try it out for yourself!
