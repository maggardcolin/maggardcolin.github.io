# Colin Maggard's Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This portfolio showcases various features and projects that I have created over the past few years. Below are some key highlights:

## Interactive Course Map

This website includes an interactive course map that showcases my academic journey at UW-Madison, implemented through an image map and a moveable textbox using JavaScript. This interactive feature enhances the user experience, allowing for a dynamic exploration of course-related information.

To experience the interactive course map, ensure that your window size is sufficient to view the content. Please note that this feature does not currently work on mobile devices.

## Project Sorting and Filtering

One of the notable functionalities of this portfolio is the ability to sort and filter through projects and work experiences. This interactive filtering allows users to customize their viewing experience based on different criteria, making it easier to find and explore specific projects.
