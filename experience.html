        <h3>January 2023 through Present - Remote</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently doing work for Rhiza Health, a startup company that manages payer-provider contracts
            in Web3 on the blockchain. I have been contributing to Rhiza Health since January 2023, where I started by 
            managing internal communication within the company as well as providing minor code contributions. In May through August of 2023, I began a system for onboarding 
            Windows developers and contributed to the Github repository via documentation as well as supplying code. I plan on 
            continuing my work at Rhiza Health during school breaks, especially now that I have finished the main programming 
            sequence at my university and have a deeper understanding of programming concepts and version control.
