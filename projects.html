                    <h2>GoFish - Java</h2>
                    <h3>Main focus: Artificial intelligence</h3>
                    <h4>Approximate time spent:</h4>
                    <p>The goal of this app was to create a GoFish-like game that a user plays against a computer.
                        This computer can remember which cards the player asks for that it does not have at the time, 
                        and will also remember which cards it has already asked for that the player does not have (to its knowledge).
                        The computer will ask if you have cards in this order: cards that it knows you have that it also has, cards that
                        it has that it hasn't asked you for already, then finally cards that it has that it has already asked for. I created this project 
                        in December 2023 and would describe this as a very basic AI project due to the computer player having the ability to make intelligent decisions that 
                        aren't entirely based on random chance.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How it works</h3>
                    <p>Each player has a hand, as well as a point total that is updated each time a pair is made. The deck/pond and each of these 
                        hands use ArrayLists to store the Card objects. There is a method that checks a player's hand for pairs, and with the aforementioned 
                        computer logic, it is possible to play a full game against the computer. This game follows what I would consider to be 
                        standard rules for GoFish, but individual rules are not difficult to implement and I may consider adding a way to change them, such as 
                        the number of cards drawn when your hand is empty, or using 4-of-a-kinds instead of pairs for points.

                    <h2>Portfolio Website - HTML/CSS/JavaScript</h2>
                    <h3>Main focus: Web design</h3>
                    <h4>Approximate time spent:</h4>
                    <p>
                        My main focus for this project was to become more comfortable with web design and scripting. My projects and 
                        experience pages include a filtering and sorting system that I developed using JavaScript, and my coursework page 
                        includes an interactive course map that I created using an HTML image map over a 
                        <a href="https://sankeymatic.com/build/">Sankey diagram</a>. I also spent time making this website reflexive so that 
                        it updates appropriately on different devices and resolutions. After this project, I am more comfortable with web design, 
                        and I am planning on learning and implementing other web technologies in the future to this website and others.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How the Interactive Course Map works</h3>
                    <p>
                        I used the HTML attribute "usemap" on a Sankey diagram that I created manually, and assigned a division of the class ".coursebox" 
                        to each class that I took, which has an associated description with it. Each coursebox is manually placed using coordinates 
                        onto the image, and the textbox associated with each coursebox is not visible unless the coursebox is hovered over. 
                        I also used JavaScript to update the CSS for the textbox to make it follow the user's mouse when it is over the associated 
                        coursebox.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How the sorting and filtering options on this page work</h3>
                    <p>
                        I assigned each project box the class ".project" as well as various classes and attributes that describe what type of 
                        project it is. Using JavaScript, I set it up so that each time the values are updated (or the page is loaded), 
                        the order of the boxes and which are displayed is updated according to whatever is input into the dropdown boxes. 
                        The project boxes are not visible unless their language is selected, and they are sorted by certain values if necessary. 
                        I wanted to create a robust and customizable system that would allow me to easily enter and display projects and work 
                        experiences that I have been and am currently engaged in.

                    <h2>Inventory Management - Java</h2>
                    <h3>Main focus: Database manipulation</h3>
                    <h4>Approximate time spent:</h4>
                    <p>The goal of this app was to create a system that allows a user to view and modify a database containing items with various attributes. The user is able to 
                        add or remove items, restock and sell items.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How it works</h3>
                    <p>I stored each of the items as well as a "sales" value into a csv file, which is loaded upon the app being run. Each item is then split from the csv file and placed
                        into an ArrayList. This ArrayList is able to be modified by commands specified by the user, and once these commands are run, the csv file is overwritten in the same format that 
                        it was originally in.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Secret Santa App - Java</h2>
                    <h3>Main focus: Hashmaps</h3>
                    <h4>Approximate time spent:</h4>
                    <p>
                        The goal for this app was to create an app that would match
                        each name with a different name, while avoiding someone's name being
                        matched to themselves (for a secret santa gift exchange). I implemented this 
                        using a hashmap class that I developed in my CS400 class in Fall 2023, and created 
                        JUnit tests that made sure that the output was as expected. This project utilized the 
                        programming concepts that I was learning in my class at the time, including hashmaps, 
                        circular indices, and frontend/backend development.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How it works</h3>
                    <p>
                        The app prompts the user for how many people are participating in 
                        the secret santa gift exchange, then for the names of each of the users. It then
                        sequentially assigns each user a different name, and restarts the entire process if anyone's name
                        is matched to themselves. I stored each name pair in a hashmap and checked to see if the name pair
                        existed already to determine if the process should be run again. I am also planning on implementing 
                        file output options in the code so that the names are not revealed.

                    <h3>Main focus: Digital system design</h3>
                    <h4>Approximate time spent:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Collaborated effectively with a partner to use Verilog to program a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) using Intel Quartus Prime. Created and 
                        implemented a finite state machine that allowed two players to play a timing-sensitive game of Pong on a FPGA. Scores were updated using internal Boolean  
                        logic and displayed on a set of 7-segment displays. Player input, reset, and pause functionality were implemented through use of switches on FPGA board.
                        Used testbench programs in Verilog to simulate and record output of the program under various conditions.

                    <h2>Statistical Data Generator App - Python</h2>
                    <h3>Main focus: Application of random walks</h3>
                    <h4>Approximate time spent:</h4>
                    <p>
                        The goal for this app was to create a program that would generate a set of numbers that correspond to 
                        a user-specified set of statistical parameters, namely mean and standard deviation. This program has options to
                        control the number of decimal places (precision), number of points generated, and maximum amount error permissible.
                        I created this project in Spring 2022 and it was partially because of my work on this project that I became interested 
                        in programming and going to school for it.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How it works</h3>
                    <p>
                        This program prompts the user for their intended average, standard deviation, number of data points, precision and maximum permissible error, 
                        then makes a few intermediary calculations in order to be able to supply the random.randint() function with integer values based on the number of 
                        decimal places desired. The main loop body starts off by determining the "differential" of the point, that is, how far off it is from the desired mean 
                        value. It then adds in any factors to be considered from the previous iterations of the loop, if any, and then updates a value called "leftovers" that 
                        represents the amount of "pull" we need in order to "balance" the data points around the desired mean. The created point is then appended to an array of numbers 
                        and the program repeats until all data points are created.

                    <h3>Main focus: User interfaces</h3>
                    <h4>Approximate time spent:</h4>
                    <p>
                        I created this project for the 2022 AP Computer Science Principles Create Task portion of the AP Exam. 
                        My goal was to create a word-guessing game in the style of Wordle, which was extremely popular at the time. 
                        I received a 5 on the AP CSP exam.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How it works</h3>
                    <p>
                        A random word from a very long list of five letter words is picked, and the user's guesses are checked 
                        against said list to ensure that their guesses are valid.
                        There are limits on the input length and number of guesses that the user can use. Once the word has been  
                        correctly guessed, or the user runs out of guesses, the game ends and a results screen is displayed, where the user 
                        can choose to restart the game or not.
