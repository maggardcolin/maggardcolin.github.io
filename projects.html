                <h2><a href=https://github.com/maggardcolin/gofish>GoFish - Java</a></h2>
                <h3>Main focus: Artificial intelligence</h3>
                <p>The goal of this app was to create a GoFish-like game that a user plays against a computer.
                    This computer can remember which cards the player asks for that it does not have at the time, 
                    and will also remember which cards it has already asked for that the player does not have (to its knowledge).
                    The computer will ask if you have cards in this order: cards that it knows you have that it also has, cards that
                    it has that it hasn't asked you for already, then finally cards that it has that it has already asked for. I created this project 
                    in December 2023 and would describe this as a very basic AI project due to the computer player having the ability to make intelligent decisions that 
                    aren't entirely based on random chance.
                </p>
                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>Each player has a hand, as well as a point total that is updated each time a pair is made. The deck/pond and each of these 
                    hands use ArrayLists to store the Card objects. There is a method that checks a player's hand for pairs, and with the aforementioned 
                    computer logic, it is possible to play a full game against the computer. This game follows what I would consider to be 
                    standard rules for GoFish, but individual rules are not difficult to implement and I may consider adding a way to change them, such as 
                    the number of cards drawn when your hand is empty, or using 4-of-a-kinds instead of pairs for points.

                <h3>Main focus: Database manipulation</h3>
                <p>The goal of this app was to create a system that allows a user to view and modify a database containing items with various attributes. The user is able to 
                    add or remove items, restock and sell items.
                </p>
                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>I stored each of the items as well as a "sales" value into a csv file, which is loaded upon the app being run. Each item is then split from the csv file and placed
                    into an ArrayList. This ArrayList is able to be modified by commands specified by the user, and once these commands are run, the csv file is overwritten in the same format that 
                    it was originally in.

                <h3>Main focus: Hashmaps</h3>
                <p>
                    The goal for this app was to create an app that would match
                    each name with a different name, while avoiding someone's name being
                    matched to themselves (for a secret santa gift exchange). I implemented this 
                    using a hashmap class that I developed in my CS400 class in Fall 2023, and created 
                    JUnit tests that made sure that the output was as expected. This project utilized the 
                    programming concepts that I was learning in my class at the time, including hashmaps, 
                    circular indices, and frontend/backend development.
                </p>
                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>
                    The app prompts the user for how many people are participating in 
                    the secret santa gift exchange, then for the names of each of the users. It then
                    sequentially assigns each user a different name, and restarts the entire process if anyone's name
                    is matched to themselves. I stored each name pair in a hashmap and checked to see if the name pair
                    existed already to determine if the process should be run again. I am also planning on implementing 
                    file output options in the code so that the names are not revealed.

                <h2>Pong Game - Verilog (created in ECE 352)</h2>
                <h3>Main focus: Digital system design</h3>
                <p>
                    Collaborated effectively with a partner to use Verilog to program a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) using Intel Quartus Prime. Created and 
                    implemented a finite state machine that allowed two players to play a timing-sensitive game of Pong on a FPGA. Scores were updated using internal Boolean  
                    logic and displayed on a set of 7-segment displays. Player input, reset, and pause functionality were implemented through use of switches on FPGA board.
                    Used testbench programs in Verilog to simulate and record output of the program under various conditions.

                <h2><a href=https://github.com/maggardcolin/data-generator>Statistical Data Generator App - Python</a></h2>
                <h3>Main focus: Application of random walks</h3>
                <p>
                    The goal for this app was to create a program that would generate a set of numbers that correspond to 
                    a user-specified set of statistical parameters, namely mean and standard deviation. This program has options to
                    control the number of decimal places (precision), number of points generated, and maximum amount error permissible.
                    I created this project in Spring 2022 and it was partially because of my work on this project that I became interested 
                    in programming and going to school for it.
                </p>
                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>
                    This program prompts the user for their intended average, standard deviation, number of data points, precision and maximum permissible error, 
                    then makes a few intermediary calculations in order to be able to supply the random.randint() function with integer values based on the number of 
                    decimal places desired. The main loop body starts off by determining the "differential" of the point, that is, how far off it is from the desired mean 
                    value. It then adds in any factors to be considered from the previous iterations of the loop, if any, and then updates a value called "leftovers" that 
                    represents the amount of "pull" we need in order to "balance" the data points around the desired mean. The created point is then appended to an array of numbers 
                    and the program repeats until all data points are created.
