                I am a second-year Computer Engineering and Computer Science student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 
                currently doing work for Rhiza Health. I have a strong passion for web development and programming, and in my 
                free time I enjoy working out and listening to music. I created this website in order to gain more experience with pure 
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to be able to fully develop a large project from the ground up.
                <br><br>
                I am looking for full-time internship opportunities during the summer and am open to being flexible in order 
                to work during the school year. I am also interested in research opportunities as well as collaboration on projects. 
                I greatly value any feedback that I receive, so I encourage you to connect with me using any method on my Contact page!
                <br><br>
                My technical skills include the following languages: Java, C, HTML/CSS, JavaScript/Typescript, Python, Verilog, Matlab, and Arduino, and 
                the following operating systems: Linux and Windows. I have also worked with Jira and Notion project tracking software.
